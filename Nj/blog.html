            <p>In school I always give time to myself to study to reach my full potentials of any learnings in School. I am also approachable of any different kind of situations, I'd like to help every one of my fellow humanity and I enjoy playing my favorite sport which is called basketball and this helps me to relax and express myself.</p>

I believe in giving my best effort in everything I do, whether it's academic, personal, or professional. I don't shy away from challenges; rather, I approach them with a relentless drive and a mindset that I will overcome any obstacles in my way. It's not just about completing something—it's about pushing myself to grow and improve with every step I take.</p>
